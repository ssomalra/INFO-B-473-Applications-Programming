# INFO-B 473: Applications Programming
This repository contains the coding assignments from the INFO-B 473: Application Programming for Biomedical Analysis course.

## Overview
The curriculum offers an introduction to the following programming languages:
- Unix
- Python
- R
- HTML

## Assignment 1: Unix
This script provides instructions to search for an archived file called 'deleteme', unarchive its contents, and remove them. The script also downloads a taxonomy data file from the NCBI FTP site. 

Required files:
- deleteme.tar - an archived file
- assign1.sh - a shell script file 

Execution:
1) Open the terminal
2) Change working directory to location of the shell script
       cd Downloads
3) Run the script by using following command
       bash assign1.sh 
4) Once execution is complete, check output to see if files were removed from deleteme, and if the taxonomy data
   file was downloaded.

Output files:
taxdump.tar.gz

## Assignment 2: Python
This script provides instructions to execute basic python commands such as coding mathematical operations, creating and modifying lists, creating and reading dictionaries, and for loops.  

Required file: assign2.ipynb - a notebook document by Jupyter Notebook containing Python code

Required package: math module - to use the .sqrt() function

Execution:
1) Open Jupyter Notebook
2) Upload the assign2.ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook
3) Open the assign2.ipynb file
4) Click on the 'Cell' tab, then select 'Run All'
5) Once the code in all the cells have been executed, check the output

## Assignment 3: Python
The script provides instructions to execute python commands that uses functions and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Required files:
- assign3.ipynb - a notebook document by Jupyter Notebook containing Python code
- file1.txt - a text file containing genomic data
- file2.txt - a text file containing genomic data

Required packages:
- NumPy - used to create and analyze an array
- Pandas - used to load and analyze a DataFrame
- matplotlib - used for data visualization

Execution:
1) Open Jupyter Notebook
2) Upload the Assignment_3.ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook
3) Open the Assignment_3.ipynb file
4) Click on the 'Cell' tab, then select 'Run All'
5) Once the code in all the cells have been executed, check the output

## Assignment 4 - R
This script provides instructions to execute various R commands such as coding vectors, creating functions, reading files, and plotting various visualization graphs (e.g. heatmaps and scatterplots)

Required files:
- Assignment_4.R - a script from R Studio containing the R code to be executed
- Assignment4.csv - a file containing a dataset with comman separated values

Execution:
1) Open R Studio
2) Upload and open the Assignment_4.R file on R Studio
3) Highlight all the code in the R Script 
4) Click on the 'Run' button in the header 
5) View the output in the R console

Output files:
- Assign4_Heatmap.png
- Assign4_ggplot.png
